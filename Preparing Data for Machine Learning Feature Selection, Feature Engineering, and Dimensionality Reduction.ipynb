    "\n",
    "These methods are used to extract patterns from data, and sometimes predict future events. The data that goes into the algorithms are called features, and we can modify our set of features using feature engineering, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction. We can often improve our ML models dramatically with these methods that we cover here."

    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is where we take features and predict a target. In other words, we take inputs and predict an expected output. An example of this is classifying if someone will default on a loan (fail to pay a loan back). For example, we might have someone's credit score, yearly income, age, and job title, and could use that to predict the probability that they default on their loan. Our inputs, or features, would be the credit score, income, age, and job title, and the target (which we could call the output or label) would be if someone will default on their loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within supervised learning, there are two subgroups – classification and regression. Classification is where our outputs are categorical. This can be binary classification, as with the loan default example. In that case, our outputs are default/no default, which can also be represented as 1 and 0 for default and no default. We can have multi-class classification as well, where we have several classes we are trying to predict. For example, we could classify the breed of a dog based on an image. The targets for multi-class classification can also apply to a single data point. For example, we could be predicting which objects are present in an image; this would be a multi-label, multi-class classification, where each data point could have multiple labels or targets. Most of the time, we will have binary classification or multi-class classification where each target has one label. We will learn more about classification in Chapter 11, Machine Learning for Classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other subgroup of supervised learning is regression. This is where we are predicting a continuous numeric value, like the temperature outside. Each data point has input features and a single target. We will learn more about regression in Chapter 13, Machine Learning with Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is used to extract patterns out of data without using a target variable. Most of these techniques include clustering, where we see how data groups together. Some of the dimensionality reduction techniques we will discuss at the end of the chapter can be used for unsupervised learning as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one other class of ML algorithms that combines unsupervised and supervised learning: semi-supervised learning. This utilizes a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to make target predictions for a dataset"

    "## Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are using features to predict a target, some of the features will be more important than others. For example, if we are predicting whether someone will default on a loan, their credit score will be a much better predictor of default than their height and weight. While we can use a large number of features as inputs to ML models, it's much better to minimize the number of features we're using with feature selection methods. ML algorithms take computational power and time to run, and the simpler and more effective we can make the input features, the better. With feature selection, we can screen our inputs for those that have the most promise. These features should have some relationship to the target variable so that we can predict the target with the features. Then we can throw out variables that aren't going to help predict the target."

    "### The Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is related to a concept called \"the curse of dimensionality.\" This idea is that as our number of dimensions (features) increases, a few things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The volume of the sample space grows exponentially with increased dimensions\n",
    "- We need exponentially more data to sufficiently cover the sample space as we increase our dimensions\n",
    "- The difference in relative distances between points approaches zero.\n",
    "- The distance to the center of the data (mean) increases and every point looks like an outlier\n",
    "- Any arbitrary grouping of samples becomes linearly separable. Hence, over-fitting because we fit to noise in the data instead of the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> One of the biggest problems here is that our models can overfit to the data with too many dimensions."

Lastly, we are saving the report to an HTML file so we can open it in another browser window. When there are many columns in the dataset, it helps to do this.

    "The other columns that don't have much variety are mainly the columns starting with PRI and SEC. These are other loans from the customer where the customer is the primary or secondary signer on the loan. These columns have 0s for more than 50% of their values, and some have 0s as 90% or more of their values. It's not clear if these 0s are all truly 0, or if some of them are missing values. We will make it simple here and drop all PRI and SEC columns, although we could keep these and use some of our feature selection techniques to check whether these are related to the target variable. We first create a list of PRI and SEC columns using a list comprehension, and then add it to our existing list using the extend method of lists. This extend function modifies the list in place, so we don't need to assign the output back to the list. Finally, we drop these columns:"

If we are missing less than 10% of the data in a column, we can usually impute it with methods such as mean, median, or KNN imputation."

This throws off the scaling of the bar plot, so we are ignoring that value. We can see that the biggest correlation is the CNS score, which has a correlation of around -0.4 with loan defaults. This means that a higher CNS score is a lower chance of default, which makes sense."

    "Here, we first import a few functions from scipy and pandas for the Pearson correlation and a function for checking if a column has a numeric datatype. We loop through all the columns except the last one (which is LOAN_DEFAULT) with a for loop. Then we check whether each column is numeric, and if so, we calculate the Pearson correlation. Conventionally, we set our alpha value (significance level) to 0.05, and if the p-value is smaller than this, we can say that our correlation is significantly different from 0. In the last line, we are using f-string formatting to print out the column (c), the correlation value to 4 decimal places, and True or False if the p-value is less than 0.05. We are using some features of Python string formatting here. First, we are aligning the column to the left and padding it with spaces to reach 40 characters with c : <40. Then we are specifying the correlation variable to be printed to four decimal places as a float with {correlation : .4f}. These tweaks make the printout easier to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We can also use feature-feature correlations to try and trim down our features. For example, from the pandas-profiling report, we can see that the asset cost and disbursed amount are highly correlated. We should consider keeping only one of these columns if they have a high correlation value (this could be above 0.7 or 0.9). This is especially true if two features are perfectly colinear, meaning their Pearson correlation is 1.0. Although more complex ML methods can deal with collinearity, linear and logistic regression typically cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You'll also notice that if you don't use minimal=True in the pandas-profiling report, it generates correlation plots. These plots show some other methods: phi-k and Cramer's V. Cramer's V is suitable for measuring the strength of categorical-categorical relationships, but ideally, a corrected version of Cramer's V should be used. The function and example usage for a corrected version of Cramer's V can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39266194/4549682."

It can also capture non-linear relationships between data, unlike Pearson's correlation. Phik uses the chi-squared test as its foundation.

The phik correlation works for interval data by binning values into groups and then using another statistical test (chi-squared) to calculate the relationship between the two variables.

If we are looking at the other categorical columns, we do not bin the feature.\n",

    "We can see that the first five features ordered by the phik correlation seem to have a strong correlation. Most of these are actually category datatypes, except for the CNS score (credit score). This strong correlation agrees with the Pearson correlations we saw, where the CNS score was the strongest correlation. Many of the flag features seem to have a weak correlation with the target variable, and the PAN and passport flags have non-zero p-values. However, these p-values are smaller than 0.05 (the usual alpha value), so the correlation still seems significant, although weak. If we were to use this for feature selection (we are not in this example), we might consider throwing out variables with correlations weaker than 0.1 (features starting at the voter ID flag) or correlations less than 0.2 (starting at the state ID feature)."

    "The first line uses NumPy's array argsort method to get the indices of the sorted array (from least to greatest). We reverse this so that we have the indices from greatest to least with indexing: [::-1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we create our plot using plt.subplots. The first two arguments are the number of rows and columns for our subplots. It returns the figure object, which we store in f, and the axes objects, stored in ax. We can then get the first row's subplot with ax[0]. We create the bar plot of explained variance ratios using our greatest-to-least sorted index variable, idx. We can index NumPy arrays with a list of values or an array like this (but not Python lists). Then we set the title and x axis label for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we get the absolute value (with the built-in abs() function) of the coefficients for each of the features for the first PCA dimension. This is the PCA dimension that explains the biggest amount of variance in the data, so it is the most important to examine first. We again use argsort and reverse this with [::-1] indexing. This gives us the index values for the first PCA component's feature importances, sorted from greatest to least. We then use that to index the components_ property of our pca object for our bar plot on the second subplot (which is on the second, or bottom, row), ax[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we set the x-axis tick labels with plt.xticks so that the labels will be the feature names. This xticks function takes the tick locations as the first argument and the new labels as the second argument. We convert our interval_columns list to a NumPy array so we can index it with our sorted index, comp_idx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we also rotate the labels by 90 degrees so that they are readable. Finally, we set the title for this second subplot and use tight_layout() to make sure all the figure components are visible and not overlapping. Our result looks like this:"

    "From this, we can see the first PCA dimension makes up a little over 20% of the variance in the data, closely followed by the second PCA dimension with around 20% explained variance. We see that this first PCA dimension is mainly composed of the disbursed amount and asset cost. Looking back at our initial EDA, we can see that these two columns are actually strongly correlated. As mentioned earlier, we may only want to keep one of these columns since they are strongly correlated. Beyond these first two important features, we see that the rest of the features have much smaller coefficients, meaning they are less important in this first PCA dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once we have our transformed PCA data (loan_pca), we can access the PCA components with the column indexer. For example, if we wanted to select only the first two PCA components, we would use loan_pca[:, :2].\n",
    "\n",
    "This selects all rows with the first colon, and then selects the first column up to the second column (an index of 1) with :2. We can use PCA to reduce our dimension size, but choosing the number of PCA dimensions to keep depends on your application. For ML, we can try increasing numbers of PCA dimensions and see how it affects the performance of our algorithms (for example, we could examine the accuracy of predictions from an ML algorithm). Once our accuracy reaches a plateau, we might stop adding PCA dimensions. There are other methods for determining the number of important PCA components, which are heuristics and should not be blindly relied upon. Many of these are described in a paper by Cangelosi and Goriely here:` https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6150-2-2`. In our case above, the only PCA component we might not use would be the last one, since the explained variance is very low. So, we could reduce our dimensionality by one."
